# QAL Lite

**QAL Lite 0.9.5** is the free, publicly-available, lightweight version of **QAL 0.9.5**.

**QAL** (Quantum Algorithms Lab) is an innovative visual interactive web app for *teaching* and *researching* quantum algorithms and quantum informatics, as well as related mathematical fields such as linear algebra and group theory.

**QAL Lite** presents a glimpse of the main features of QAL.  Check the `QAL-Abstract` and `QAL Lite-Screenshots` files in [QAL Docs](./docs/) for more details on QAL and QAL Lite and the few differences between them.

Besides quantum computing, the math nicely presented in QAL has applications in machine learning and AI, computer graphics, cybersecurity, and many other mathematical sciences.

As to teaching math, QAL aims to teach the concepts of linear algebra and group theory visually and interactively, as an intuitive mathematical *game* that presents a target configuration/state to be reached from an initial configuration/state. (For more on this, check the `QAL Game Mode` GPP---Graduation Project Proposal---in [QAL Docs](./docs/).)

For what&lsquo;s new in this version of QAL Lite, check the `What&lsquo;s New` page of `QAL Help`.  QAL also has a fledgling `QAL User Guide` that you may like to check in `QAL Help`.

QAL Lite is currently hosted on GitHub, and is also hosted and accessible from [here](http://eng.staff.alexu.edu.eg/staff/moez/QAL/Lite).

(Feeling adventurous? Want to save your quantum algorithms to local QAL files and to open QAL files developed by others? Want to use &lsquo;controlled gates&rsquo; and &lsquo;swap gates&rsquo; directly in your quantum algorithms? ...
